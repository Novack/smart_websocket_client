It is a great tool for testing. But it still lack some features. I hope that Smart Websocket Client will fill the gap.\r\n\r\n# ScreenShot\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/VUcGU7e.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n* Rich text editor integration\r\n* Remember history input like some web api testing tools(postman) does.\r\n\r\n# Future Features\r\n* Create fake messages for testing. This is useful if the backend is not ready yet but you want to develop your frontend code now(going to be implemented).\r\n* Account system, you can share the messages to your team. \r\n\r\n# Install && Build\r\n\r\n### Important\r\nThis project dependent on react-ace. But there is a bug and a feature have not been merged to the original repository. This project can be built without error but it will raise error when run. \r\n\r\n> npm install // install dependencies\r\n\r\n> npm run watch // you can open localhost:8080 to try it\r\n\r\n> npm run build // generate build files in dist folder\r\n\r\n> PRODUCTION=1 npm run build // build minified version of build files\r\n\r\n# Notice\r\n\r\nThis tool has not been pushed into Chrome App Store. I am trying to get the developer fee paid first. Not about money, but I cannot pay it easily in China.\r\n\r\nYou can load it to Chrome directly after building(a new folder called dist is generated).\r\n \r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/AJ98GJj.jpg)\r\n\r\nTurn on Developer mode && Load unpacked extension. Click the new icon appeared on the right of address bar. You got it :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
