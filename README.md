# Smart Websocket Client
Smart Websocket Client is a chrome extension to help developers develop and test websocket.

# Why another websocket client
I checked websocket clients in chrome web store and I am using Simple Websocket Client. It is a great tool for testing. But it still lack some features. I hope that Smart Websocket Client will fill the gap.

# Features
* Detect the format of the message be sending or reciving, parse it if it is in json format.
* Remember history input like some web api testing tools(postman) does.
* Create fake messages for testing. This is useful if the backend is not ready yet but you want to develop your frontend code now.

# Future Features
* Account system, you can share the messages to your team.
